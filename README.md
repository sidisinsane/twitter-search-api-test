# Twitter Search API Test

A simple Twitter Search API Test using the [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) Twitter API Client.

## Getting Started

First walk through the [Developer steps at Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/account/get-started) if you haven't already.

Then run `npm install` and enter your Credentials and [Query Parameters](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets) into the `index.js.tpl` and rename it to `index.js`. The query is urlencoded by [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit).
__Attention!__ The `index.js` is excluded from commiting in the `.gitignore` file. You might want to change that.
 
Now run `npm start`. That's it!
